Yahoo!
Yahoo! [7][8] is an American web services provider headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, and owned by Verizon Media.[9][10] The original Yahoo! company was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was incorporated on March 2, 1995.[11][12] Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the early Internet era in the 1990s.[13]

It provides or provided a Web portal, search engine Yahoo! Search, and related services, including Yahoo! Directory, Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Finance, Yahoo! Groups, Yahoo! Answers, advertising, online mapping, video sharing, fantasy sports, and its social media website. At its height it was one of the most popular sites in the United States.[14] According to third-party web analytics providers Alexa and SimilarWeb, Yahoo was the most widely read news and media website – with over 7 billion views per month – ranking as the sixth-most-visited website globally in 2016.[6][15][16]

Once one of the largest internet companies, Yahoo slowly declined starting in the late 2000s,[17][18] and in 2017 Verizon Communications acquired most of Yahoo's Internet business for $4.48 billion,[19][20][21] excluding its stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! Japan, which were transferred to Yahoo's successor company Altaba.[22] Despite its decline from prominence, Yahoo domain websites are still among the most popular, ranking 10th in the world according to the Alexa rankings as of October 2019.[23]

In January 1994, Yang and Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University, when they created a website named "Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web".[24][25] The site was a directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In March 1994, "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web" was renamed "Yahoo!".[26][27] The human-edited Yahoo! Directory, provided for users to surf through the Internet, became their first product and the company's original purpose.[28][29] The "yahoo.com" domain was created on January 18, 1995.[30]

The word "yahoo" is a backronym for "Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle"[31] or "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle".[32] The term "hierarchical" described how the Yahoo database was arranged in layers of subcategories. The term "oracle" was intended to mean "source of truth and wisdom", and the term "officious", rather than being related to the word's normal meaning, described the many office workers who would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work.[33] However, Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the slang definition of a "yahoo" (used by college students in David Filo's native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an unsophisticated, rural Southerner): "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth."[34] This meaning derives from the Yahoo race of fictional beings from Gulliver's Travels.

In 1995, a search engine function, called Yahoo! Search, was introduced. This allowed users to search Yahoo! Directory.[35][36] Yahoo soon became the first popular online directory and search engine on the World Wide Web.
