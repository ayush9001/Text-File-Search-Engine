# Text-File-Search-Engine
A software tool, allowing you to quickly and easily search text in files on your computer. It was inspired by search engines like Google, Bing and YouTube. User inputs search query and the program goes through all files and checks if any matches found. Then it displays the titles of all files that match the searched term in order of relevance (page rank). 
This project helped me better understand concepts of information retrieval, file handling, exception handling and object oriented programming.
